## Heeeeey!

<p>
I'm Yadiel, a software engineer based in New York specializing in user interfaces and design systems. I also have extensive experience with distributed systems, including everything from databases to backend APIs. 
</p>

Currently, I'm focused on exploring client-server architectures to boost web performance—leveraging techniques like static site generation, server-side rendering, and streaming SSR. Feel free to reach out for a virtual coffee chat!

Let's connect and maybe swap some code stories over a virtual coffee! ☕️
